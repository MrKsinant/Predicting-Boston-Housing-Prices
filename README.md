# Predicting Boston Housing Prices

This study corresponds to the first project of the nanodegree *Machine Learning Engineer*, schooled by **Udacity, Inc.** (https://eu.udacity.com), a for-profit educational organization offering massive open online courses.

Its goal is to provide a machine learning model able to **predict homes prices in the Boston area**, based on a modified version of the Boston housing dataset found on the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing): This modified Boston housing dataset consists of 489 data points, with each datapoint having three features (`RM`, the average number of rooms per dwelling, `LSTAT`, percentage of population considered lower status, and `PTRATIO`, the pupil-teacher ratio by town) and one target variable (`MEDV`, the median value of owner-occupied homes).

In this repository, you will find the following files:
* The file ***predicting-boston-housing-prices.ipynb***, the Jupyter Notebook which contains all the detailed and explained study, accompanied by the results obtained;
* The file ***visuals.py***, a Python file which contains functions allowing to visualize specific results obtained during the study;
* The file ***housing.csv***, the modified Boston housing dataset used for this study.

Finally, to conclude, respectively to the requirements, it can be said that the machine learning model built within this study has been constructed thanks to **Scikit-Learn** (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), a very popular and complete machine learning framework.
